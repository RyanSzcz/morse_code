morse_code language 
-------------------------------------

I have created a morse_code language based off of the BF lnaguage.
Morse_code uses four characters { . , - _ } to accomplish a number of basic opperations. 
The ",-" command increments the data pointer, ",." decrements it. 
The "." command increments the value in the datapointer, "-" decrements it.
The ",_" command outputs the ASCII value in the current point in memory, and "_," takes input from the command line and replaces the value at the current point with the input. 
"__." is used to start a loop and ".__" is used to end a loop. 

-------------------------------------
 
When entering ASCII values on the command line the user must enter three values. If ASCII code is less than three values, follow the correct code with a space. 
Its very suprising the amount one can do with only four characters.

-------------------------------------

To run the language, run python morse.py, then type program into command line. I have included sample programs in sample_programs.txt.
